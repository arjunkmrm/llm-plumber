John: Hi everyone, thanks for joining today's meeting to discuss the progress on our Q2 marketing initiatives. Sarah, let's start with you - can you give us an update on the social media campaigns you've been working on?

Sarah: Sure thing. So far the Instagram reels campaign is performing really well - we're seeing a 25% increase in engagement compared to our regular posts. I think the short video format is resonating with our audience. On the other hand, the LinkedIn articles aren't getting as much traction as we hoped. I suggest we put that initiative on pause and reallocate the budget to double down on Instagram. What do you all think?

Michael: I agree, no point continuing to invest in the LinkedIn articles if we aren't seeing results. I vote we shift focus to Instagram.

Priya: Makes sense to me too. We should go where we're seeing the highest ROI.

John: Okay, sounds like we're aligned on pivoting away from LinkedIn to focus on Instagram reels. Sarah, please update the marketing plan and budget accordingly by end of week and send it over to me for review.

Sarah: Got it, I'll have the updated plan to you by Friday.

John: Perfect. Moving on, Michael, what's the latest on the website refresh project?

Michael: The new website designs are almost finalized and we're on track to launch at the end of next month. The only outstanding item is getting approval on the revised copy from legal. I sent it over to them last week and am waiting to hear back.

John: Sounds good. I know the legal review is outside of your control, but please keep on top of it and let me know if there are any delays that would jeopardize launching on schedule. Also, can you set up a meeting with the web development team to walk through the final designs and confirm everything is in order?

Michael: Absolutely, I'll follow up with legal and schedule a meeting with the web team for early next week. I'll send out an invite to everyone on this call.

John: Great, thanks Michael. Priya, last but not least, how are things going with the event sponsorship?

Priya: I have some exciting news on that front - I was able to negotiate a 20% increase in our sponsorship package with the conference organizers. So we'll be getting more promotion and better booth placement at no additional cost.

John: That's fantastic, well done Priya! I'm thrilled to hear it. Can you put together a brief overview of what's included in the sponsorship package and circulate it to the team? I want to make sure we're fully capitalizing on all the benefits.

Priya: Of course, I'll put that together and send it out by tomorrow. I'm also going to start working on the logistics for the booth setup and staffing. I'll coordinate with Sarah on getting the marketing collateral together.

Sarah: Sounds good Priya, just let me know what you need from me and my team.

John: Excellent collaboration, Priya and Sarah. Okay, to recap - Sarah is going to update the marketing plan to focus on Instagram over LinkedIn by EOW, Michael is working on getting legal approval for the new website copy and setting up a review meeting with the web team, and Priya is going to send out a summary of our sponsorship benefits and start planning the event logistics. Anything else to cover today?

[No one raises additional topics]

John: Alright, I think that wraps up today's agenda then. Thanks everyone for the productive meeting and keep up the great work! Let's touch base again next week.
